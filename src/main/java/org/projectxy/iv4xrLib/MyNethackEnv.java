	/**
	 * In principle this is the primary method you need to implement. This method is the one
	 * that will send a command to the SUT and reports back the state of the SUT.
	 * 
	 * IMPORRTANT: the method should return an instance of WorldModel (eu.iv4xr.framework.mainConcepts.WorldModel).
	 * The SUT might send something else; but this method sendCommand_() should
	 * then transform it into an instance of WorldModel. It can be literally an
	 * instance of WorldModel, or a subclass of it if you have created your own
	 * subclass to enrich it.
	 * 
	 * The method sendCommand_() sends a command, which is represented as an instance 
	 * of the class EnvOperation (nl.uu.cs.aplib.mainConcepts.Environment.EnvOperation).
	 * 
	 * To create a command we can use the constructor of EnvOperation:
	 * 
	 *    new EnvOperation(String invokerId, 
	 *                     String targetId, 
	 *                     String command, 
	 *                     Object arg, 
	 *                     Class expectedTypeOfResult)
	 *    
	 *    invokerId: the id/name of the agent at the SUT-side which we want to command.
	 *    command:   the command for the agent meant by invokerId to do something (e.g. 
	 *               to move, or to interact with something else)
	 *    targetId:  if the command is a command like "interact" it usually also involves 
	 *               the target of the interaction (e.g. imagine a command for agent A in the SUT to
	 *               open a door in the SUT; A would be invokerId, and the door would be the target).
	 *               
	 *    arg:       a single object that is the parameter of the command. For example a command like "move"
	 *               might require a direction to be specified as a parameter. Only one parameter is
	 *               accomodated in this protocol. If you need multiple parameters, you should wrap it
	 *               in a single object and deal with packing and unpacking.
	 *               
	 *    expectedTypeOfResult: can be ignored for now.
	 *    
	 * Examples: 
	 *     
	 *        new EnvOperation("agent0",null,"Observe",null,Dontcare.class)
	 *        new EnvOperation("agent0","button1","Interact",null,Dontcare.class)
	 *
